              MongoDB is the most popular of the new breed of non-relational
              NoSQL databases. Specifically, it's a document database, also
              called a document-oriented database or a document store.

              Document structures usually align with objects that developers are
              working with in code, which is a more flexible approach than the
              row-and-column table-oriented structure of a relational database.
              Developers can rework document (data) structures as their
              application requirements change over time. With this approach,
              data structures become like code â€” both are under developers'
              control.

              does not matter if different programming languages and teams write
              it. You can also test the small units individually.

              JSON Web Tokens are the new fancy kids around the block when it
              comes to transporting proofs of identity within an untrusted

              A JWT is a mechanism to verify the owner of some JSON data. It's
              an encoded, URL-safe string that can contain an unlimited amount
              of data (unlike a cookie) and is cryptographically signed. When a
              server receives a JWT, it can guarantee the data it contains can
              be trusted because it's signed by the source

              JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of
              claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two
              parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand.
              For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it
              is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.{" "}

              A JWT is a string made up of three parts, separated by dots (.),
              and serialized using base64. In the most common serialization
